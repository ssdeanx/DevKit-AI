# Meet the Agents: Your Specialized AI Team

The power of DevKit AI Pro lies in its roster of specialized agents. Each agent is an AI with a unique persona, a specific task, and a tailored configuration. The **Orchestrator** automatically selects the best agent for your request, but understanding their roles can help you craft more effective prompts.

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip:** You can fine-tune the parameters for every agent (like temperature, creativity, and tools) in the [**Settings & Customization**](./07-settings-and-customization.md) view.

| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`ChatAgent`**         | Your primary conversational partner. It's a highly capable generalist, perfect for coding questions, debugging, brainstorming, and explanations.      |
| **`PlannerAgent`**      | The master strategist. It deconstructs complex, multi-step tasks (e.g., "research a topic and then write code about it") into a logical plan for other agents to execute. It is chosen automatically for complex requests. |
| **`FunctionCallingAgent`** | An application controller. It uses tools to perform actions within the app itself. Use it for commands like "navigate to the settings view" or "change the temperature of the ReadmeAgent to 0.8". |
