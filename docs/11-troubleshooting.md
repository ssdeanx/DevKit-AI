# Troubleshooting & FAQ

This page provides answers to common questions and solutions for potential issues you might encounter while using DevKit AI Pro.

### GitHub Inspector

#### **Q: I'm getting an error that says "GitHub API rate limit exceeded." What should I do?**

**A:** This is the most common issue when using the GitHub Inspector. The GitHub API limits the number of requests you can make without authentication.

**Solution: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)**
1.  **Generate a PAT:** Follow GitHub's official guide to [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
    -   When selecting scopes, you only need to grant `public_repo` access for public repositories. For private repositories, you will need to grant the full `repo` scope.
2.  **Add the PAT to DevKit:**
    -   Go to the **GitHub Inspector** view.
    -   Paste your newly generated token into the "GitHub API Key (Optional)" field.
3.  **Reload:** Click "Load Repository" again.

Your PAT is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is only used to make authenticated requests to the GitHub API, which provides a much higher rate limit.

#### **Q: The file tree is taking a long time to load or says it's "truncated."**

**A:** This happens with very large repositories that contain thousands of files. The GitHub API may truncate the response to save bandwidth. While the core files should still be visible, you might not see everything. For now, the best practice is to work with smaller to medium-sized repositories or be aware that the file tree may be incomplete for massive monorepos.

### AI Generations

#### **Q: My generated README or Code Graph seems generic and not specific to my project.**

**A:** This is almost always a context issue. The AI can only be specific if you provide it with specific information.

**Solution: Stage More Files**
1.  Go back to the **GitHub Inspector**.
2.  Ensure you have staged the key files that represent your project's logic. For a README, this might include your main application file (`App.tsx`, `main.py`), key service files, and configuration files.
3.  Return to the generator view and try again. The more relevant context you provide, the better the result will be.

#### **Q: The AI's response seems to be stuck in a loop or is not helpful.**

**A:** AI models can sometimes get stuck or misinterpret a prompt.

**Solution: Give Negative Feedback & Retry**
1.  Click the **Thumbs Down (ðŸ‘Ž)** icon on the response.
2.  A feedback modal will appear. Briefly explain what was wrong (e.g., "You are repeating the same thing," or "This answer is incorrect.").
3.  Submitting the feedback will trigger a retry attempt where the AI is instructed to correct its mistake based on your feedback.
